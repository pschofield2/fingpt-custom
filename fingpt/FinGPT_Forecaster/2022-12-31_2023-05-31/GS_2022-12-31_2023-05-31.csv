He says he was \""stunned\"" by Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr's testimony statement, which says \""it is not the job of supervisors to fix the issues identified; it is the job of the bank's senior management and board of directors to fix its problems.\"" The problems present in the banking sector should be addressed, Nocera says, by bringing back the \""sensible regulations\"" originally imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar. \""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided\"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.

According to several reports, days before the chaos ensued, SVB paid its employees annual bonuses, while CEO Greg Becker cashed out over $2 million worth of the bank stocks. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, joined Brad Smith and Julie Hyman to discuss the bank collapse. \""It really is important that we find ways to claw back proceeds, because people who are responsible for decisions that collapsed a bank should not be able to make profits or get compensation from that bank,\"" he says. \""Certainly not in close proximity to the time that it went under,\"" he adds.The Senator emphasized that although emergency measures were taken, this move by the government was not a bailout. \""This is not 2008, when there was a bailout of the banks.

He\u2019s the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and perhaps the most well known banker on the planet. Dimon was officially named CEO in 2006, but his true rise to stardom came during the 2008 financial crisis Born in New York City to a family of bankers, Dimon went to Tufts University where he studied philosophy and economics, followed by Harvard Business School, before starting his career at American Express (AXP). It was there that Jamie Dimon became the protege of legendary financier Sandy Weill and in 1985 they both left AMEX to run consumer financing company, Commercial Credit, under Weill\u2019s leadership. Over the next decade, Dimon and Weill made a series of large mergers and acquisitions, including Primerica (PRI), Travelers Corp (TRV), and Solomon Brothers, until brokering a massive $76 billion merger to form Citigroup (C) in 1998. Not long after, Weill asked Dimon to resign. \u201cI was fired in 1998. It\u2019s a painful thing. My boss who I had worked with for 15 years, called me in and said, \u2018we want you to resign,\u201d\u2019 Dimon said while speaking to Harvard graduates back in 2009. But nonetheless, he went off to find success on his own, landing a job as CEO of Bank One, which was one of America\u2019s largest banks at that time. In 2004, Bank One was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and on January 1, 2006 Dimon was named CEO.. He led JPMorgan through the financial crisis of 2008, acquiring battered competitors Bear Sterns and Washington Mutual, which became major contributors to JPMorgan\u2019s expansion into Europe and Asia. \u201cOur finest year was 2009. Our profits were down, I think, like 50% or 60%. But we stood behind our clients around the world, governments, city-states, schools, hospitals. And that was the finest year we had,\u201d Dimon told Yahoo Finance in a 2019 interview. Today, with more than $3.3 trillion in assets under management, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in America.
